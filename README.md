# Digital Systems
Lab work for Digital Systems accomplished using VHDL and Altera Quartus. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

Covers digital logic circuits and emphasizes on good understanding of basic concepts in modern digital system design. Introduces computer aided design (CAD) tools including the use of hardware description language (HDL) for design entry. It also discusses the use of the latest available implementation technologies including CPLDs and FPGAs for mapping the design to modern technology. This course covers basic logic circuits, Boolean algebra, and implementation technology (from transistor to CPLDs and FPGAs). It also introduces logic functions optimization and implementation, number representation and arithmetic circuits, combinational circuits, synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuits as well as introduction to control unit data path and CPU operations. The Laboratory work requires the uses of CAD tools to design and simulate basic digital circuits. Implementation and testing of simple digital systems in LSI and CPLD will also be considered.

# Key Objectives
1. The theoretical and technical knowledge of design methodology from the lecture will be applied in the labs
   using design tools (AlteraÂ® QuartusÂ® II, AlteraÂ® FPGA boards) for analysis, simulation, visualization,
   synthesis, and design. Modern instrumentation such as logic analyzer, oscilloscope, etc. will be utilized to
   collect and validate the digital data. Learning various mathematical models and design methods for digital
   systems, such as Boolean algebra and optimization design strategies, gives the student the ability to solve
   principle engineering problems Selects and uses an appropriate method for problem definition. Describes
   differences between methods, performs a specified method in hypothetical design situation.
